BRIGHT LIGHTS BASEMENT IS A MERN STACK APP CREATED BY ROGER CAMERO

THE FOCUS OF BRIGHT LIGHTS BASEMENT IS TO SHOWCASE THE WORK CREATED BY THE TWO HOUSE ENGINEERS
OF BRIGHT LIGHTS STUDIO, ROGER CAMERO AND EROL ULUG.

THIS APP UTILIZES:

    - REACT JS
    - BOOTSTRAP CSS
    - MONGODB
    - NODE JS
    - NPM MDBREACT
    - NPM AXIOS
    - NPM EXPRESS
    - NPM BODY-PARSER
    - NPM FONTAWESOME
    
BRIGHT LIGHTS BASEMENT IS ALSO A MOBILE RESPONSIVE APP, FEATURING LINKS TO POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, AS WELL AS DIRECTLY EMBEDDED YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWCASING WORK FROM THE STUDIO.

MONGODB IS USED TO STORE THE WEBSITES DATA, WHICH FEEDS THE SITE CONTENT.

FUTURE GOALS FOR THE SITE ARE TO HAVE AN ADMIN USER AUTHORIZATION WHICH ALLOWS THE ADMIN TO FILL OUT A FORM WHICH, WHEN PROPERLY FILLED OUT, WILL SEND A NEW JSON OBJECT TO MONGODB FOR IMMEDIATE RENDERING TO THE SITE.

ANOTHER GOAL IS TO HAVE A SEARCH BAR IN THE NAVBAR ONCE THE DATABASE GROWS LARGE ENOUGH TO CALL FOR A SEARCH BAR ADDITION.
